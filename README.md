## Key Features

* Multiple stop watchers to track each phase of problem-solving (reading, thinking, etc)
* Automating details like entering a hyperlink to solution code, problem code, and writing today's date in the comment field of google sheets
* Time-saver when solving in a competition (even though the problem will initially be saved as '...')

## How To Use

1. Download and open the installer exe file from [here](https://github.com/OdyAsh/problem_tracker/blob/main/installers/problem_tracker_installer.exe)

2. Install the app:

3. Copy [this training sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1waZ8nH1GRXRbM2gXym5W1AGQ0bB73PWXhOi7-ijxCnc/edit?usp=sharing) to your own Google drive (AND DON'T MODIFY THE HEADER ROW (row 1)):

> **Optional:**
> I suggest you check out the "Info" worksheet of the training sheet or watch [this video by Dr. Mostafa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3lmvYBxgwE) to understand how to use the sheet for worksheets other than "External"

4. Copy the new sheet's ID:

5. Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/3UJ6RnWTGIY?t=82) to create a Google service account:

6. Paste the obtained credentials (step 5), google sheet's id (step 4), the name of the worksheet ("External"), and your CodeForces handle (username) to the app, then choose a problem:

**Note:**

**v2.0 Note:**
You can now choose different worksheets other than "External" when submitting a problem

7. Use the app to track details while solving the problem:

8. Submit and check your Google Sheet's spreadsheet:

9. Don't forget to press 'x' when the problem is added to sheets!!!:

10. Keep tracking different problems and repeating steps 7 to 9 :]

**Implementation note about using web scraping on first submission page only:**

## Download

Follow steps 1 to 3 mentioned above :]

In addition, if you want this app to run on linux or mac, clone the project, and type in the command prompt (in vs code):

``` flutter build linux ```

for Mac:

``` flutter build macos ```

Then you will find the executable file here: ```build/LINUX (or MACOS)/runner/release```

## "To-Do"s
* Be able to add submission link of CSES problem to google sheets 
* Be able to add tutorial link that was present in google sheets as a `=HYPERLINK(...)` instead of just text, and move it to "Resources" column
* Make the app available on Android
* Update readme.md's gifs to match new update (possibly upload a youtube video as a demonstration instead)
